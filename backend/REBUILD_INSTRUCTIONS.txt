FIX FOR UserRepository COMPILATION ERROR
==========================================

The error is caused by IntelliJ IDEA using stale compiled classes.

SOLUTION (Do these steps in order):

1. STOP the application if it's running

2. In IntelliJ IDEA:
   - Go to: File > Invalidate Caches...
   - Check: "Clear file system cache and Local History"
   - Click: "Invalidate and Restart"
   - Wait for IntelliJ to restart

3. After restart:
   - Go to: Build > Rebuild Project
   - Wait for compilation to complete

4. If still not working:
   - Right-click on "backend/pom.xml" in Project tree
   - Select: Maven > Reload Project
   - Then: Maven > Lifecycle > clean
   - Then: Maven > Lifecycle > compile
   - Then: Build > Rebuild Project

5. Start the application again

The UserRepository.java file exists and is correct. This is purely an IntelliJ build cache issue.
