FIX FOR "package org.springframework.data.jpa.repository does not exist"
=======================================================================

This error means Maven dependencies are not properly downloaded or IntelliJ hasn't recognized them.

SOLUTION:

1. In IntelliJ IDEA, open the Maven tool window:
   - View > Tool Windows > Maven
   - OR click the "Maven" tab on the right side of the IDE

2. In the Maven tool window:
   - Find your project: "stock-management"
   - Expand it
   - Click on "Lifecycle"
   - Double-click "clean" (wait for it to complete)
   - Double-click "validate" (this will download dependencies)
   - Double-click "compile" (this will compile the project)

3. If that doesn't work, reload the Maven project:
   - Right-click on "stock-management" in the Maven tool window
   - Select "Reload Project"
   - Wait for dependencies to download

4. Alternative: Use IntelliJ's Maven reload:
   - Right-click on "backend/pom.xml" in the Project tree
   - Select: Maven > Reload Project
   - Wait for "Indexing..." to complete

5. After dependencies are downloaded:
   - Build > Rebuild Project
   - Wait for compilation to complete

6. If still not working, invalidate caches:
   - File > Invalidate Caches...
   - Check "Clear file system cache and Local History"
   - Click "Invalidate and Restart"
   - After restart: Maven > Reload Project, then Build > Rebuild Project

VERIFICATION:
The pom.xml file has the correct dependency:
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
  </dependency>

This should automatically include spring-data-jpa. The issue is that IntelliJ hasn't downloaded or recognized the dependencies yet.
